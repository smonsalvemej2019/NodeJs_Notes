npm (node package manager)
we manage our modules trough npm
using the

    'npm init' 

command, npm will create a json file with information 
about our projects and the modules it depends on.
Adding new modules will automatically add the name of that module under dependencies 
within our json file. There is dev only dependencies as well used only during development.

for ex nodemon (dependency used to prevent constant server restart)

we can install development only dependencies by using the command

npm install -D dependenciesName

the npm_modules file is not passed to a remote server. The package.json file
will keep track of all dependencies needed. If we delete the nodes_modules file, 
we can easily just reinstall all needed dependencies by simply using 

npm install 

command
the package-lock.json will help keep track of dependencies and npm will download 
all of them

we can write scripts for our environment 
We wrote a script in our package.json that allows us to use nodemon 
because nodemon is not installed globally, it is better to write a script for it
now we can type "npm run dev(the name of our script)" and it will use nodemon
